# Hey! I'm Gabriel Netz ðŸ™‚


## About Me:

I'm Brazillian, but currently i live in London as a international student at the University of Greenwich, attending a Computer Science Degree.

Currently, i work at the university as a research developer, mainly with the [EUNOMIA Research Group](https://www.eunomia.social/ "EUNOMIA"), a research project funded by the European Unionâ€™s H2020 research and innovation programme, on the development of a Trustworthiness nudge for the Social Media platform. Previous projects as a research developer included the development of the [NETATMO Machine Learning](https://github.com/gabrielnetz/NetAtmoMachineLearning "NETATMO") module, used for the VR-IOT project.

I've also helped on the development of the Yu-Gi-Oh [Asulla Piscu FTK Simulator](https://replit.com/@MarcusPatel/FTKMath#README.md "FTK"), a very fun personal project which involved both my love for computing and trading card games, and it is explained with more detail in this popular [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNiyaKrNPF8&t=66s "FTK") we created explaining the logic begind it
