#Hey! I'm Gabriel Netz ðŸ™‚

## About Me:
<img align="right" width="32%" src="https://i.imgur.com/Lu8oC2K.png">
  
I'm Brazilian, but currently I live in London as an international student at the University of Greenwich, undertaking a Computer Science degree.
<br>
<br>
Currently, I work at the university as a research developer, mainly with the [EUNOMIA Research Group](https://www.eunomia.social/ "EUNOMIA"), a research project funded by the European Unionâ€™s H2020 research and innovation programme, on the development of a Trustworthiness nudge for the Social Media platform. Previous projects as a research developer included the development of the [NETATMO Machine Learning](https://github.com/gabrielnetz/NetAtmoMachineLearning "NETATMO") module, used for the VR-IOT project.

I've also helped on the development of the Yu-Gi-Oh [Asulla Piscu FTK Simulator](https://replit.com/@MarcusPatel/FTKMath#README.md "FTK"), a very fun personal project which involved both my love for computing and trading card games, and it is explained with more detail in this popular [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNiyaKrNPF8&t=66s "FTK") we created explaining the logic behind it.

## Areas of Experience:

My main programming languages are Python and Javascript, but I do have experience working in multiple other different languages. I'm currently doing my degree endorsement in Data Science and Machine Learning, which are areas that I am passionate about, currently work in, and plan to keep learning more in the future. You can check my [CV](https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/document/C4D2DAQF1nZNv-wqOCA/profile-treasury-document-pdf-analyzed/0/1604671570628?e=1622145600&v=beta&t=Ih8aKJ7omm4G2hB9Z3PlvYI2mYeLsJYP3XIb4vjangw "FTK") for more information about my current and previous work and academic experiences.

## Projects:

Due to university and work commitments, most of my projects are closely related to those. But, I am open to freelance work, especially during summer time, so in case you are interested, you can contact me through the next section
